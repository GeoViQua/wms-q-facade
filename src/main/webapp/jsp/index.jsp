	<p>The WMS-Q Server Facade is implemented as a development help
						for the WMS-Q Web Client Greenland developed within the project
						GeoViQua. It allows to annotate the capabilities document of any
						WMS server with keywords according to the WMS-Q specification,
						effectively telling a user/client software which layer contains
						which information, for example data values, standard deviation, or
						variance. The server facade is intended for testing and
						development. Therefore it did not undergo testing of stability or
						any user studies and should be seen as software in an "alpha"
						state.</p>
